After unpacking the posted tar file, you should find the following files:

   README              - usage instructions (this file)
   ./dev               - directory for implementing your solution
      c02driver.c         - test driver
      ASMParser.h         - supplied C header file; do not modify!
      ASMParser.c         - file for implementing the ASMParser module
      ParseResult.h       - supplied C header file; do not modify! 
      ParseResult.c       - file for implementing the ParseResult module
      Grade.h             - declaration for grading function; do not modify!

      Generate.h          - declaration for test data generator; do not modify!
      Generate.o          - 64-bit CentOS binary for test data generator
   ./grading              - directory for running the grading code
      gradeC02.sh         - script file that runs the testing process; read the header comment!
      C02Grader.tar       - grading code, including:
         c02driver.c      - test driver
         ASMParser.h      - supplied C header file 
         ParseResult.h    - supplied C header file
         Grade.h          - declaration for grading function
         Grade.o          - 64-bit CentOS binary for grading function 
         Generate.h       - declaration for test data generator
         Generate.o       - 64-bit CentOS binary for test data generator

Manual Testing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
For manual testing (especially if you want to use gdb), in ./dev:
    - edit ASMParser.c and ParseResult.c as needed
    - compile your files with the grading harness:
        gcc -o c02driver -std=c11 -Wall -W -ggdb3 c02driver.c ASMParser.c ParseResult.c <names of your other .c files, if any> Generate.o Grader.o
    - execute the test driver:  
        ./c02driver <name for test data file> <name for results file>

This will create new test data and graded results.  See the results file
for details.  

The test driver randomizes the test cases.  If you want to reuse the previous
set of test cases, look in the results file from the previous test and find 
the line that lists the random seed value that was used:

Seed value: 1579713594

Then, run the test driver this way:
        ./co2 driver <name for test data file> <name for results file> -seed <seed value>


Automated Testing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To use the automated grading package in ./grading:
    - create a tar file containing your ASMParser.c and ParseResult.c
        files and nothing else; copy that tar file into ./grading
    - if necessary, run chmod a+x to make the script gradeC02.sh executable
    - execute the grading script:
         gradeC02.sh <name of your tar file>

The grading script will extract the first token from the name of your zip
file and use that in naming the generated report file.  We recommend that
you name your tar file PID.tar, where PID is your VT email PID, since 
that is the naming convention used when you submit your solution to us
for grading.    

Watch the terminal window for any error messages from the script.  Check
the file PID.txt for grading results; if that file was not created (due
to some irrecoverable error), check the other text files created by the
grading process.

If you get an error message about the build failing, then your tar file 
is defective or your source code is defective.

If you get any other error messages, you need to diagnose the error and
fix the problem. Return to the dev directory to fix the relevant issues, then try the autograder again.

The script will create the following files:
         
        buildLog.txt       output from the build process
        vgrindLog.txt      full output from Valgrind test
        vgrind_issues.txt  summary of Valgrind results
        prefix.txt         full report, including all of the logs above,
                           where "prefix" is the first token of the name
                           you gave your tar file
